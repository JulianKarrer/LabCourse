For this, the information about density fluctuations is actively propagated through the fluid and pressure values are updated until the targeted density is satisfied. With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the WCSPH results.},

  abstract   = {Realistic handling of fluid-air and fluid-solid interfaces in SPH is a challenging problem. The main reason is that some important physical phenomena such as surface tension and adhesion emerge as a result of inter-molecular forces in a microscopic scale. This is different from scalar fields such as fluid pressure, which can be plausibly evaluated on a macroscopic scale using particles. Although there exist techniques to address this problem for some specific simulation scenarios, there does not yet exist a general approach to reproduce the variety of effects that emerge in reality from fluid-air and fluid-solid interactions. In order to address this problem, we present a new surface tension force and a new adhesion force. Different from the existing work, our surface tension force can handle large surface tensions in a realistic way. This property lets our approach handle challenging real scenarios, such as water crown formation, various types of fluid-solid interactions, and even droplet simulations. Furthermore, it prevents particle clustering at the free surface where inter-particle pressure forces are incorrect. Our adhesion force allows plausible two-way attraction of fluids and solids and can be used to model different wetting conditions. By using our forces, modeling surface tension and adhesion effects do not require involved techniques such as generating a ghost air phase or surface tracking. The forces are applied to the neighboring fluid-fluid and fluid-boundary particle pairs in a symmetric way, which satisfies momentum conservation. We demonstrate that combining both forces allows simulating a variety of interesting effects in a plausible way.},

The compression scheme is inspired by Stream VByte, but uses a non-linear mapping from data to data bytes, yielding memory savings of up to 87\%. It is part of a novel variant of the Cell-Linked-List (CLL) concept that is inspired by compact hashing with an improved processing of the cell-particle relations. We show that the resulting neighbour search outperforms compact hashing in terms of speed and memory consumption. Divergence-Free SPH (DFSPH) scenarios with up to 1.3 billion SPH particles can be processed on a 24-core PC using 172 GB of memory. Scenes with more than 7 billion SPH particles can be processed in a Message Passing Interface (MPI) environment with 112 cores and 880 GB of RAM. The neighbour search is also useful for interactive applications. A DFSPH simulation step for up to 0.2 million particles can be computed in less than 40 ms on a 12-core PC.},

In this paper, we present a local Poisson SPH (LPSPH) method to solve incompressibility for particle based fluid simulation. Considering the pressure Poisson equation, we first convert it into an integral form, and then apply a discretization to convert the continuous integral equation to a discretized summation over all the particles in the local pressure integration domain determined by the local geometry. To control the approximation error, we further integrate our local pressure solver into the predictive-corrective framework to avoid the computational cost of solving a pressure Poisson equation globally. Our method can effectively eliminate the large density deviations mainly caused by the solid boundary treatment and free surface topological change, and show advantage of a higher convergence rate over the predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH).},

This facilitates not only the initialization process but also allows the simulation of multiple dynamic objects. Thin structures consisting of only one layer or one line of boundary particles, and also non-manifold geometries can be handled without any additional treatment.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present the novel concept of density maps for robust handling of static and rigid dynamic boundaries in fluid simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). In contrast to the vast majority of existing approaches, we use an implicit discretization for a continuous extension of the density field throughout solid boundaries. Using the novel representation we enhance accuracy and efficiency of density and density gradient evaluations in boundary regions by computationally efficient lookups into our density maps. The map is generated in a preprocessing step and discretizes the density contribution in the boundary's near-field. In consequence of the high regularity of the continuous boundary density field, we use cubic Lagrange polynomials on a narrow-band structure of a regular grid for discretization. This strategy not only removes the necessity to sample boundary surfaces with particles but also decouples the particle size from the number of sample points required to represent the boundary. Moreover, it solves the ever-present problem of particle deficiencies near the boundary. In several comparisons we show that the representation is more accurate than particle samplings, especially for smooth curved boundaries. We further demonstrate that our approach robustly handles scenarios with highly complex boundaries and even outperforms one of the most recent sampling based techniques.},

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in its standard form is known to exhibit spurious oscillations in the pressure field. A commonly used approach is to introduce numerical diffusion inside the continuity equation for a smoother pressure field creating the popular {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}-SPH variant. This study focuses on the dependence of lateral pressure gradient evolution on numerical speed of sound and density diffusion for a neutrally buoyant circular cylinder in plane Poiseuille flow. Simulations with and without numerical density diffusion are compared for different numerical speeds of sound in weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) framework. The {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}-SPH formulation is observed to display increased pressure oscillations for higher speeds of sound resulting in loss of equilibrium. A scaling correction to the free parameter in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}-SPH formulation is proposed. The proposed correction is noted to reduce the pressure oscillations as well as density gradients across the fluid--structure interface significantly, increase overall stability of the scheme and as a result, assist the rigid body to achieve steady motion regardless of the release position.},

  abstract = {Migration pattern of a neutrally buoyant object is primarily controlled by the lateral pressure gradient displaying high sensitivity to pressure disturbances in the flow field. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in its standard form is known to exhibit spurious oscillations in the pressure field. A commonly used approach is to introduce numerical diffusion inside the continuity equation for a smoother pressure field creating the popular {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}-SPH variant. This study focuses on the dependence of lateral pressure gradient evolution on numerical speed of sound and density diffusion for a neutrally buoyant circular cylinder in plane Poiseuille flow. Simulations with and without numerical density diffusion are compared for different numerical speeds of sound in weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) framework. The {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}-SPH formulation is observed to display increased pressure oscillations for higher speeds of sound resulting in loss of equilibrium. A scaling correction to the free parameter in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\$}{\$}-SPH formulation is proposed. The proposed correction is noted to reduce the pressure oscillations as well as density gradients across the fluid--structure interface significantly, increase overall stability of the scheme and as a result, assist the rigid body to achieve steady motion regardless of the release position.},
